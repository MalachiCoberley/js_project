**Welcome to my Javascript Project: Double the Bubble Trouble(name definitely pending)**

in Bubble trouble, the player attempts to pop all bubbles on the screen within a given time limit.
-they can only move left and right across the bottom plane of the screen 
-they can only shoot straight up, requiring them to be underneath a bubble to pop it.
-each time a bubble is popped, it divides into two smaller bubbles.
-if a bubble touches the player, they will lose a life.
-the round ends when all of the bubbles are popped, or the player has lost all of their lives.

**Functionality & MVP**
In  Double the Bubble Trouble(name definitely pending), users will be able to:
   -Start, pause, and reset the game.
   -move left and right
   -shoot a bubble popper
   -score points for completing levels
   
In addition, this project will include:
  - basic gameplay instructions
  - a production README

**Wireframes**

-Nav links will be my github, linkedin, and soundcloud
-game controlls are <--, -->, space, and p to open a pause menu.

**Technologies, Libraries, APIs**
  -The Canvas API to render the game board
  -Webpack and Babel to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code
  -npm to manage project dependencies

**Implementation Timeline**
 **-Friday Afternoon & Weekend**
    Get webpack working. Get familar with using the canvas API and add a canvas to the page. Lock in the scale of each object. Begin creating board, player, and bubble classes.
 **-Monday**
    This day will be wholly dedicated to implementing user controls. If there is time, I will begin adding the logic for bubble collision with the projectile, the player, and the ground.
 **-Tuesday**
    Finish up work on bubble collision and add logic for bubble division. Implement a level timer  and score system based on completion time, and a win state.
 **-Wednesday**
    If i've made things modular and simple enough, I can try adding additional levels or challenges, otherwise this day will be entirely dedicated to wrap-up and polish.
 **-Thursday Morning**
    refactor and deploy project.
